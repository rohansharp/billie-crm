# billie-crm - Epic Breakdown

## Overview

This document provides the complete epic and story breakdown for billie-crm, decomposing the requirements from the PRD, UX Design, and Architecture into implementable stories.

## Requirements Inventory

### Functional Requirements

**Customer Intelligence (Search & View):**
- **FR1:** Staff can search for customers using partial or exact matches on Name, Email, Mobile Number, or Customer ID (minimum 3 characters).
- **FR2:** Staff can search for loan accounts by Account Number or Application ID.
- **FR3:** Staff can search for specific transactions by Payment Reference or Transaction ID.
- **FR4:** Staff can view a "Single Customer View" dashboard aggregating Profile, Accounts, and recent Transactions.
- **FR4.1:** Staff can filter the transaction history by Transaction Type (e.g., Fees, Repayments) and Date Range.
- **FR5:** Staff can view the latest known balances (Principal, Interest, Fees, Total) for all active loan accounts.
- **FR6:** Staff can view a chronological history of all financial transactions for a specific loan account.
- **FR7:** Staff can view customer identity flags (e.g., "Staff", "Investor", "Vulnerable") clearly on the dashboard.

**Financial Operations (Write Actions):**
- **FR8:** Staff can initiate a "Waive Fee" action directly from the loan account view.
- **FR9:** Staff can initiate a "Record Repayment" action (manual bank transfer entry) from the loan account view.
- **FR10:** Staff can initiate a "Write-Off" request for an account balance, triggering an approval workflow.
- **FR10.1:** Staff can cancel their own pending write-off requests before they are approved.
- **FR11:** System must optimistically update the UI balance immediately upon action submission (before server confirmation).
- **FR12:** System must revert the optimistic update and display an actionable error toast with retry option if the backend action fails.

**Governance & Audit (Compliance):**
- **FR13:** Approvers (Supervisors) can view a queue of pending "Write-Off" requests.
- **FR13.1:** Approvers can sort/filter the approval queue by Date Requested, Amount, and Requestor.
- **FR14:** Approvers can Approve or Reject a write-off request with a mandatory comment.
- **FR15:** Compliance Officers can view an immutable audit log of all financial mutations (who, what, when, reason).
- **FR15.1:** Audit logs and transaction histories must support server-side pagination to handle large datasets.
- **FR16:** System must cryptographically link the Approver's identity to the approved transaction event.
- **FR17:** Staff cannot approve their own requests (Segregation of Duties).
- **FR17.1:** Staff can view their current approval limits and permissions directly in the UI.

**Notification & Workflow:**
- **FR18:** Approvers receive a real-time notification (Toast) when a new request is assigned to their queue.
- **FR19:** Staff receive a notification when their request is Approved or Rejected.
- **FR22:** Staff can view the sync status (e.g., "Saving...", "Synced", "Failed") of any recent write action.
- **FR23:** Failed actions must trigger a persistent alert in a global notification center that remains visible across page navigation.

**System Health & Resilience:**
- **FR20:** Staff can view a "System Status" indicator showing the health/latency of the Event Processor connection.
- **FR21:** The application automatically switches to "Read-Only Mode" if the connection to the Event Processor is lost, disabling write actions.
- **FR24:** System must detect version conflicts (e.g., modifying a stale account state) and prompt the user to refresh the data.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- **NFR1 (Responsiveness):** UI interactions must respond in < 100ms (Optimistic UI).
- **NFR2 (Data Freshness):** Background data must refresh every 10 seconds with immediate revalidation on write actions.
- **NFR3 (Load Time):** Single Customer View must achieve FCP in < 1.5 seconds.

**Security:**
- **NFR4 (Access Control):** All API routes must validate user role (Support vs. Approver) against session token.
- **NFR5 (Data Minimization):** Frontend must strictly type API responses to prevent over-fetching PII.
- **NFR6 (Auditability):** All write actions must log actor_id, resource_id, action_type, timestamp, reason to immutable event store.

**Reliability & Resilience:**
- **NFR7 (Graceful Degradation):** UI must enter "Read-Only Mode" within 30 seconds of Ledger Service outage detection.
- **NFR8 (Error Recovery):** Optimistic UI failures must trigger user-dismissible toast with "Retry" action.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an action fails due to system error (not validation)
**When** the failure occurs
**Then** the action is added to the notification center with: Action type, Account, Timestamp, Error message, Retry button

**Given** I have failed actions in the notification center
**When** viewing the Payload admin header
**Then** a notification badge shows the count of failed actions

**Given** I click on a failed action in the notification center
**When** the system is back online
**Then** I can click "Retry" to re-attempt the action

**Given** I successfully retry or dismiss a failed action
**When** the notification center updates
**Then** the action is removed from the list

**Given** the browser tab closes
**When** I return later
**Then** failed actions persist (stored in localStorage with TTL)

### Story 5.4: Version Conflict Detection

As a **support staff member**,
I want to be alerted when data has changed since I loaded it,
So that I don't overwrite someone else's changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I loaded a customer's account at version 5
**When** another user modifies the account (version 6)
**Then** my next action attempt returns a version conflict error

**Given** a version conflict is detected
**When** the error displays
**Then** a modal shows: "This record was modified by another user. Please refresh to see the latest data." with Refresh button

**Given** I click "Refresh" on a version conflict
**When** the data reloads
**Then** I see the latest version and can retry my action

**Given** I am editing a form when a conflict is detected
**When** the conflict modal appears
**Then** my unsaved changes are preserved in a "Your changes" section for reference

---

### Story 5.5: Graceful Error Handling

As a **support staff member**,
I want system errors to display helpful messages,
So that I understand what went wrong and what to do next.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** any API call fails
**When** the error is a known error code
**Then** display the user-friendly message from `ERROR_MESSAGES` constant

**Given** any API call fails
**When** the error is an unknown error
**Then** display "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again or contact support." with error ID for support reference

**Given** a network timeout occurs
**When** the error displays
**Then** show "Request timed out. Please check your connection and try again." with Retry button

**Given** an error occurs
**When** the toast/modal displays
**Then** include a "Copy error details" link for support tickets (includes error ID, timestamp, action attempted)

## Epic 6: Navigation UX

Staff have persistent navigation, a dashboard home page, and clear wayfinding throughout the application.

**User Outcome:** Staff can navigate the application intuitively via an enhanced sidebar (Dashboard, Approvals, Search, System Status), understand where they are via breadcrumbs, and start their day from a dashboard showing actionable items.

**Architectural Decision:** Sidebar-first approach - works with Payload's native sidebar architecture rather than fighting it. This reduces implementation effort and leverages Payload's built-in mobile responsiveness.

**FRs Covered:** None (UX Enhancement)
**NFRs Addressed:** NFR9 (Keyboard Nav)
**UX Covered:** UX4 (Keyboard Navigation), UX5 (Responsive)

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Sidebar-first approach:** Work with Payload's existing sidebar architecture, not against it
- Custom `Nav` component wraps Payload's `DefaultNav` to add our navigation items
- Dashboard consolidates action items from multiple sources
- Recent customers stored in localStorage for persistence (IDs only, no PII)
- Mobile responsive handled by Payload's built-in mobile sidebar
- Story 6.5 (Mobile Responsive) cancelled - Payload handles this natively

### Story 6.1: Enhanced Sidebar Navigation

As a **support staff member**,
I want the Payload sidebar to include quick navigation to key areas,
So that I can access Dashboard, Approvals, and Search without leaving the admin interface.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am logged into the Payload admin
**When** viewing any page in the application
**Then** the sidebar displays our custom navigation items above Payload's default collection links

**Given** the enhanced sidebar renders
**When** viewing the top section
**Then** I see: Search trigger (🔍), Dashboard link (🏠), and Approvals link (✅) with pending count badge

**Given** I click the Search trigger (🔍)
**When** the click is processed
**Then** the Command Palette opens (existing functionality from Epic 1)

**Given** I click the Dashboard link (🏠)
**When** the click is processed
**Then** I navigate to `/admin/dashboard`

**Given** I click the Approvals link (✅)
**When** logged in with Approver role
**Then** I navigate to `/admin/approvals`

**Given** I am NOT logged in with Approver role
**When** the sidebar renders
**Then** the Approvals link is not visible

**Given** the sidebar renders
**When** viewing the bottom section
**Then** I see the Ledger Status indicator (🟢/🟡/🔴 Online/Degraded/Offline) with latency

**Given** I am on mobile/tablet
**When** using the application
**Then** Payload's built-in mobile sidebar handles responsive behavior (no custom implementation needed)

**Technical Requirements:**

**Given** the sidebar implementation
**When** configuring Payload
**Then** use `admin.components.Nav` to wrap `DefaultNav` with our custom `PayloadNavWrapper`

**Given** the PayloadNavWrapper component
**When** rendering
**Then** structure as: [Custom Nav Items] → [Divider] → [Payload DefaultNav] → [System Status]

---

### Story 6.2: Dashboard Home Page

As a **support staff member**,
I want a dashboard home page that shows actionable items,
So that I can quickly see what needs my attention when I log in.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I navigate to `/admin/dashboard`
**When** the dashboard loads
**Then** I see a personalized greeting "Good morning/afternoon/evening, {firstName}!"

**Given** I log in successfully
**When** Payload redirects after authentication
**Then** I am redirected to `/admin/dashboard` (not the default Payload collection list)

**Given** the dashboard loads
**When** there are pending approvals (and I have approver role)
**Then** an "Action Items" card shows: "✅ {count} Pending Approvals" with "Review Approvals →" link

**Given** the dashboard loads
**When** I do NOT have approver role
**Then** the "Pending Approvals" card is not shown

**Given** the dashboard loads
**When** there are failed actions in localStorage
**Then** an "Action Items" card shows: "⚠️ {count} Failed Actions" with "View Failed →" link

**Given** the dashboard loads
**When** viewing "Recent Customers" section
**Then** I see my last 5 viewed customers with: Customer ID, Name, Account count, Total outstanding, "Last viewed" timestamp

**Given** I click on a recent customer row
**When** the click is processed
**Then** I navigate to `/admin/servicing/{customerId}`

**Given** the dashboard loads
**When** viewing "System Status" section
**Then** I see: Ledger Service status + response time, Database connection status

**Given** the dashboard loads
**When** viewing the tip section
**Then** I see a contextual tip like "💡 Press ⌘K to quickly search for any customer"

**Technical Requirements:**

**Given** the dashboard component mounts
**When** fetching dashboard data
**Then** call `GET /api/dashboard?recentCustomerIds={ids}` with IDs from localStorage store

**Given** the dashboard API is called
**When** the response returns
**Then** it includes: `user`, `actionItems`, `recentCustomersSummary`, `systemStatus`

**Given** the dashboard is registered in Payload
**When** configuring `payload.config.ts`
**Then** use `admin.components.views.DashboardView` with `path: '/dashboard'`

---

### Story 6.3: Breadcrumb Navigation

As a **support staff member**,
I want to see breadcrumbs showing my location in the application,
So that I can understand the page hierarchy and navigate back easily.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am on the Dashboard (`/admin`)
**When** viewing breadcrumbs
**Then** no breadcrumb is displayed (root page)

**Given** I am on ServicingView for customer "John Smith"
**When** viewing breadcrumbs
**Then** I see: "🏠 › Customer CUST-001 › John Smith"

**Given** I am on ApprovalsView
**When** viewing breadcrumbs
**Then** I see: "🏠 › Approvals"

**Given** I click "🏠" in the breadcrumb
**When** the click is processed
**Then** I navigate to the dashboard home

**Given** I am viewing a nested page
**When** the breadcrumb displays
**Then** the current page name is bold and not a link

---

### Story 6.4: Recent Customers Store

As a **support staff member**,
I want my recently viewed customers to persist across sessions,
So that I can quickly return to customers I was helping.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I navigate to a customer's ServicingView
**When** the page loads
**Then** the customer is added to my "recent customers" list

**Given** I view the same customer multiple times
**When** the recent customers list updates
**Then** the customer appears only once, moved to the top with updated timestamp

**Given** I have viewed more than 10 customers
**When** viewing the recent customers list
**Then** only the most recent 10 are stored (FIFO)

**Given** I close my browser and return later
**When** viewing the dashboard
**Then** my recent customers persist (stored in localStorage)

**Given** I click "Clear History" on the recent customers section
**When** the action completes
**Then** all recent customers are removed from storage

**Security Requirements:**

**Given** the localStorage persistence mechanism
**When** storing recent customer data
**Then** ONLY store non-PII data: `customerId` (string) and `viewedAt` (timestamp)

**Given** the dashboard displays recent customers
**When** rendering customer details (name, account count, balance)
**Then** fetch fresh data from the server using stored IDs (do NOT cache PII in localStorage)

**Given** an XSS attack compromises localStorage
**When** the attacker reads `recent-customers` key
**Then** they can only see customer IDs and timestamps (no names, emails, or financial data)

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Zustand persist middleware with localStorage backend
- Store minimal schema: `{ customers: Array<{ customerId: string, viewedAt: number }> }`
- Dashboard component fetches customer summary data via authenticated API using stored IDs
- No customer names, emails, phone numbers, or financial data stored client-side

### Story 6.5: Mobile Responsive Navigation

**STATUS: CANCELLED** ❌

*This story has been cancelled as part of the sidebar-first architectural decision.*

**Reason:** Payload CMS v3 includes built-in mobile-responsive sidebar navigation. Our enhanced sidebar (Story 6.1) automatically inherits this responsive behavior without any custom implementation.

**What Payload provides natively:**
- ✅ Hamburger menu trigger on mobile
- ✅ Slide-in sidebar panel
- ✅ Touch-friendly navigation
- ✅ Automatic breakpoint handling

**Remaining mobile considerations (handled in other stories):**
- Dashboard cards stack vertically (CSS in Story 6.2)
- Recent customers use card layout on mobile (CSS in Story 6.2)

---

### Story 6.6: User Menu Enhancements

**SCOPE REDUCED** - Payload provides most user menu functionality natively.

As a **support staff member**,
I want to view my recent activity from the user menu,
So that I can review actions I've taken.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I click on my avatar/name in Payload's header
**When** the dropdown opens
**Then** I see Payload's default items PLUS a new "My Activity" link

**Given** I click "My Activity"
**When** the link navigates
**Then** I see a filtered view of the audit log showing only my actions

**What Payload provides natively (no implementation needed):**
- ✅ User name and email display
- ✅ Sign Out functionality
- ✅ Account settings link

**What we add:**
- 🆕 "My Activity" link to filtered audit log

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Payload's `admin.components.logout` or `afterNavLinks` to inject our link
- My Activity view can reuse the existing audit log component with a user filter

---

### Story 6.7: Role-Based Collection Visibility

As a **system administrator**,
I want Payload's sidebar to show different collections based on user roles,
So that operational staff see a clean, task-focused interface while admins retain full system access.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am logged in with role "operations" or "supervisor" or "readonly"
**When** the sidebar renders
**Then** I do NOT see Payload's default collection links (Users, Media, etc.)
**And** I only see our custom navigation items (Search, Dashboard, Approvals)

**Given** I am logged in with role "admin"
**When** the sidebar renders
**Then** I see all Payload collection links AND our custom navigation items

**Given** I successfully authenticate
**When** Payload completes the login process
**Then** I am redirected to /admin/dashboard (not the default collection list)

**Role Definitions:**
- `admin` - Full system access (sees all collections)
- `supervisor` - Operations + approval authority (no raw collections)
- `operations` - Day-to-day servicing (no raw collections)
- `readonly` - View-only access (no raw collections)

**Technical Notes:**
- Use `admin.hidden` on collections to control sidebar visibility
- Configure `admin.custom.afterLogin` for dashboard redirect
- Redirect authenticated users from `/` to `/admin/dashboard`
